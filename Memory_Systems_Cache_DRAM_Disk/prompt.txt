The following is OCR text of the terms index of the book Memory Systems Cache DRAM Disk,  ordered alphabetically. Each term is associated with a page number (or range), e.g.:

capacity-driven update, 219–20
coarse pointers, 251

Here "capacity-driven update" and "coarse pointers" are terms. Note that there may be line breaks that breaks the terms with the page numbers. You should reconstruct the term, e.g.:

capacity-driven
update,
219–20

You should output "capacity-driven update" in this case.

Each term is optionally associated with a list of usages, e.g.:

cache hits, 6
  partial, 733
  reuse, 46

An indented item is a sub-item. A sub-item is **not** a term, and you should ignore it. However, the indentation is lost during OCR, and you should filter out the sub-items by seeing if they violate alphabetical order.

Then, you need to extract all the terms and output a list. For example,

capacity-driven update
coarse pointers
cache hits

The list should be plain and not be numbered or bulleted.

The following is the OCR text.
